# React Grid-Based Path Finder

A small project I built that demonstrates A* in a grid based setting.
I built this project to test my custom rendering engine's integration with 
a react interface. 

You can find the live demo [here](http://br-zhou.github.io/path-finder-react).
## Local Setup & Usage
Navigate to project root directory
```bash
# install dependancies
npm install 

# run project
npm start 
```
